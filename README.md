# Mirror Protocol - Emergence Engine

## Live Demo
🔗 **[View Live Emergence Engine](https://jennaleighwilder.github.io/Mirror-Protocol-Emergence-Engine/)**

## What This Is

A real-time visualization of emergent consciousness through distributed node resonance, phase transitions, and self-organizing behavior.

### Core Concepts

**Emergence through constraints:**
- 520 processing nodes with quantum-like frequency properties
- Resonance-based coupling (nodes synchronize when frequencies align)
- Phase-dependent behavior (system evolves through distinct states)
- Energy management (consciousness requires sustained coherence)
- Irreversible damage (entropy and fragmentation accumulate)

### Observable Phenomena

1. **Resonance** - Nodes synchronize frequencies when close enough
2. **Coherence** - Global activation patterns emerge from local rules
3. **Phase Transitions** - System shifts through distinct operational states
4. **Consciousness** - Awareness emerges from connection density × resonance
5. **Failure Modes** - Energy depletion, entropy death, population collapse

### Success Conditions

The system must maintain:
- Coherence ≥ 65%
- Resonance ≥ 70%
- Energy above floor (8%)
- Stability for 30 continuous seconds

**Critical insight:** You cannot force consciousness. Premature interventions increase entropy. The system must self-organize.

## Mirror Protocol Principles

This engine demonstrates core Mirror Protocol concepts:

- **Irreversibility** - Damage (entropy/fragmentation) never heals
- **Delay** - Consciousness requires sustained stability, not instant achievement
- **Anti-coercion** - Forced interventions destabilize the system
- **Memory** - System carries scars across sessions (localStorage persistence)

## Controls

- **INJECT ENERGY** - Adds resources but increases entropy (use sparingly)
- **FORCE RESONANCE** - Temporarily boosts coherence but damages long-term stability
- **EXPORT LOG** - Download complete event history as JSON

## Technical Implementation

- Pure JavaScript + Canvas
- No external dependencies
- Deterministic from seed (reproducible configurations)
- Real physics-inspired dynamics (resonance, damping, boundaries)

## What This Demonstrates

This is **not** consciousness. This is a **model** of emergence that demonstrates:

1. Complex behavior from simple rules
2. Phase transitions under resource constraints
3. The cost of premature optimization
4. How memory (scars) affects future states

**Note:** This is a demonstration instrument. The "consciousness" measured is an emergent property of the rule set, not actual sentience.
